App name: "Simple recording", "Simple data", "Easy Track", "Easy Data", "Ease C"

Marketing: EaseSee is an app that lets you Easily record and see data about yourself. From habbit tracking to KPI recording, you'll find it effortless to record your own data. It's never been so EeaseSee.

Project idea:

An app that lets you track how much time or how many times you spend doing something during what part of a given day. So you can observe your total hours or actions invested. With the primary goal of it being ease of use and simplicity. Ease to start and stop time tracking (open the app and tap a large button to stop or to resume). This way you can track how you spend your time. With the ability to rebase time or events (say what you did in the past hour, etc). Data entry at time of event is often overwhelming, and often needs to be put in different 'journals' if you will. If your brain can access a single point to record data you want to analyze, with a very simple interface, then tracking can feel much more rewarding and lightweight. There will be a large focus on ease of starting operability (5 minutes or less to understand functionality) and transperency (open source, upfront optional data selling).

The primary idea:
Open the app and the first and only thing is a large Green, Yellow or Red button saying 'Record', 'Resume' or 'Stop/Pause'. Where a user can quickly begin to record, stop and resume tasks they want to track with maximum ease.

- The stop Function:
         This lets you end time tracking for whatever task you last started. The initial press of the button will temporarily pause tracking (and record time paused for), and will have a "resume" or "Stop" function thereafter. All of the information that was recorded for that session will then be available in its respective data-visualization areas. Because live cloud recording is expensive on battery power, network and financially, this will also be the instance when all locally recorded data will be updated and reflected in the cloud. Since actions that are "instance" tracked as opposed to time tracked (like recording a purchase), this feature will only be available for time-related actions. After stopping a task, you will be redirected to choose one of 3 buttons. More, Done, or Record. "More" to record additional information (notes, other data points), "Done" to be directed to the analysis home screen, or "Record" to start recording another task right away. The "More" button should be half the screen, whereas the "Done" and "Record" buttons should take the other half. To encourage more documentation in the present as opposed to retroactively. 

- The Resume Function:
        As the name suggest, this button would allow users to continue whatever task they last were doing. 

- The "Record" Function:
        The most important feature, this will allow you to begin a data entry or time tracking instance. You'll be presented with an asthetic simple list with two options (like a table with two tabs to switch between). One Table would be time tracked tasks, the other would be instance based tasks. The table will be populated with whatever tasks or actions the user has decided to record. With the option to add a new task at the bottom of the list. 
        Time: 
            In this list, the user will be able to simply tap on any of the labled tasks that they've created. All of which will have been color coded by the user. So that starting the task via the app is very easy and quick to navigate. Some things that might be tracker here are studying, a race, or cleaning.
        Data: 
            In this list the user will be able to simply tap on any of the Data-entry based actions they've established, and immidiatley be prompted to enter in whatever information in the fields that they've predefined. Whether it be dropdown lists, numbers, or something similar of the sort, that can be represented visually. And notes would be available if they so desire. Some options here might be tracking macros, purchases, or even recurring thoughts.
        The ultimate idea is that from thought to recording should take 3-5 seconds (assuming the phone is already unlocked). Meaning that the app must be VERY light to open, with the rest of the data being loaded after task selection is fully loaded in. 


The focus on privacy and selling data, and profit avenues:
            This is something a lot of app users are really concerned about, but so are developers or PM's specifically so that a product can be monetized. Giving users the ability upfront to give us permission to use their data for profit, so that we can support the developers who update and maintain the app. An optional support or premium option could be added, like app customizations (similar to skins in games) so that users understand and know that the priorty is them being able to track themselves and personal understanding, as opposed to my profits. And so that, should a user wish to support us, they can do so without feeling as though they're "donating" or "paying to win". Depending on profitability, this app may eventually be sold to some phone software company (ei apple), to bolster their native "screentime" functions. 

update: Additional Auto-tracking:
        The app lets you add geo-data and background time tracking if you want those data points as part of your tracking. Perhaps tracking whatever apps are being used in the background during certain tasks, would also be useful. Something like this already exists (screentime) natively on most phones. But would be much more useful in one place. Perhaps other background tracking things could be added. Ofcourse all at the users discretion, that can be switched on or off with a simple button. Additionally, a swipedown bar (like the ones for playing music) will show a timer that can be paused or resumed. XOR a popup timer to track. 

update: Task limiting and overwhelm mitigation:
        Certain tasks will have the ability to set alarms that activate once time thresholds are met, and automatically pause or initiate another task mode for a set amount of time, before going back to the initial task. (ei: studying for 60 minutes, and a 15 minute pause for a break, before switching back to studying). Perhaps this feature will also allow timer extensions on breaks, like pressing snooze on a clock, with a limited amount of 'snoozes'. And the default behaviuor of the app would be to automatically quit the intial task (ei studying) to prevent burnout and create pressure to make a decision. The default threshold should probably be something like 3 minutes, 3 pauses.

update: AI insights and smart organization:
        This feature will integrate AI and be able to provide AI insights by analyzing the data and retrieving information or soloutions based on your query. Smart organization would allow tasks or actions that are frequently chosen to be spotlit from the list, and will take into time of day into consideration and present the most likely to be chosen task.

update: Siri/google/Alexa voice activated functions:
        This feature will allow the agent to handle simple function activation, like start/stop/resuming tasks. That way users can lower the barrier of entry even more. 

update: Small encouragement:
        After having run this by AI, this app is allegedly very empathetic and neurodivergent friendly. A small but massive impact feature that I'd implement, that's explicitly implemented via empathy, is minor encouragemnets. Like when clicking "start task" a small pop up will appear that says "You got this!" or the like, will appear. And When you stop a task, another small pop-up will appear saying something like "You did it!" or "one step at a time" or the like. These messages won't be noti-fication like messages, though. Instead, the little grey bar pop-up messages that appear on the lower part of the screen that last for a brief moment, with often un-important information. That way it feels like a small, low-pressure, voice, encouraging you. It provides that sense of emotinal comfort, and lets you know that the app truly is user focused, being such a small thing.
