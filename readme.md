Hello! This is just a learning playground for me while I'm learning to code. I figured I'd learn how to use Git and Github first before anything, so that I can comfortably progress in my skills, while tracking my growth. As well as enabling myself to contribute to the projects of others when I feel confident enough. 😄
I have a very uppity/playful personality, so if you're super serious or just generally unhappy, this will all probably annoy you. 😜
